## 📈 Key Findings

### 1. Facility Distribution Patterns
- Significant spatial inequality exists in NYC athletic facility distribution
- High-income communities generally have higher facility density
- Low-income communities have poorer facility accessibility

### 2. Income Equity
- Highest income quartile communities have 2.5 times the average facility density of lowest income communities
- Positive correlation exists between income levels and facility density
- Clear "facility desert" phenomenon exists

### 3. Ethnic/Racial Differences
- Facility accessibility varies among different ethnic groups
- Some minority communities have lower facility density
- Targeted investment strategies are needed

### 4. Service Coverage Analysis
- Approximately 30% of communities lack athletic facilities within 0.5-mile walking distance
- Significant spatial differences exist in service coverage
- Facility spatial distribution needs improvement
